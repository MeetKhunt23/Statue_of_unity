            “INDIA HAS GOT A RICH CULTURAL HERITAGE OF “UNITY IN DIVERSITY”, THE
            ROOTS OF WHICH ARE INEXTRICABLY FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF
            “VASUDHAIV KUTUMBAKAM”, MEANING THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A
            FAMILY. AT THE TIME OF INDIA’S INDEPENDENCE IN 1947, IT WAS HOWEVER
            DIVIDED INTO MORE THAN 560 PRINCELY STATES AND IT WAS INDIA’S FIRST
            DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, BHARAT RATNA SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL, WHO
            WITH HIS FIRM DETERMINATION, COULD TRANSFORM SUCH IMPERIALISM INTO
            TODAY’S UNIFIED INDIA. PEOPLE OF INDIA WILL REMAIN INDEBTED TO HIM
            FOREVER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP DURING THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE AND HIS
            VISION, WISDOM AND STATESMANSHIP IN THE POST-INDEPENDENCE ERA. HIS
            LIFE IS AN ETERNAL SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR THE PRESENT AS WELL AS
            FUTURE GENERATIONS AND IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT HIS ICONIC
            MONUMENTAL STATUE – THE WORLD’S TALLEST STATUE OF UNITY HAS BEEN
            DEDICATED TO THE NATION ON THE 143RD BIRTH ANNIVERSARY. SYMBOLIZING
            THE NATIONAL, SPIRITUAL, HISTORICAL AND ACADEMIC VALUES, THE STATUE
            OF UNITY WILL LEAD TO THE ICON-BASED DEVELOPMENT OF THIS ENTIRE
            REGION, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY A TRIBAL AREA. OUR VISION IS TO MAKE
            THIS PLACE A WORLD CLASS TOURIST DESTINATION BY PROVIDING
            INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EDUTAINMENT, RESEARCH, CULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL
            ENRICHMENT AND HEALTH PROMOTION. A TRUE LEADER KEEPS ON ENLIGHTENING
            THE PATH OF MANKIND EVEN IN HIS PHYSICAL ABSENCE AND THE STATUE OF
            UNITY IS THE REALIZATION OF THIS – WORTH EXPERIENCING.”

            The Cactus Garden is a unique botanical garden at the Statue of
            Unity site, created to exhibit a huge variety of Cacti and
            succulents, the true miracles of adaptation. The thought behind the
            development of the cactus garden is to provide an experience of the
            desert ecosystem in the midst of a landmass well entrenched in an
            aquatic surrounding. There are 6 lakh plants of 450 species spread
            across 25 acres of open land and inside the dome having an area of
            836 square metres. <a href="">Read More...</a>

                Since time immemorial, architecture and monuments have given
                India her identity. From historical Ajanta & Ellora caves to
                Delwara Temple of Mount Abu and from Taj Mahal to Meenakshi
                Temple of Madurai, Indian architecture showcases its elegance
                and superiority across the globe. The most prolific creation in
                recent times, the Statue of Unity, is the World’s Tallest
                Monument. It represents more than a colossal structure facing
                the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada. It is an iconic
                symbol of the ‘Iron Man’, who played an important role during
                India’s freedom struggle and thereafter in the unification of
                the princely states. It reminds the world of the towering
                personality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the nucleus of India’s
                integration as a united country.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was the wit and whip of this ‘Iron Man’ that 562 small and
                big princely states unanimously agreed to become an integral
                part of India. The elucidation of the Statue directly correlates
                with the meaning and value of unity. While, it is one of the
                finest interpretations of the designers with its modern
                construal, it also symbolises and describes the quintessence of
                the statue to visitors. The world’s tallest statue is an
                engineering marvel that was constructed in merely 46 months.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sardar Patel, respected for his commitment and drive, took up
                the challenge of convincing all the princely states using
                diplomacy and peaceful means, or the iron hand when needed
              </p>
              <p>
                The impressive landmark commemorating Sardar Patel’s
                contribution to unification dovetails into several social
                development programmes such as improved transport and
                connectivity, institutions of research, education and tribal
                development, tourist facilities and other social infrastructure.
